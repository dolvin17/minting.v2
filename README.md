📝 Prerequisites

[ ] VS Code : as text editor

[ ] yarn : (npm was picked before but i want to learn about use yarn)
[ ] taqueria v0.28 : Tezos Dapp project tooling
[ ] taqueria VS Code extension : visualize the project and execute tasks
[ ] ligo VS Code extension : for smart contract highlighting, completion, etc ..
[ ] Temple wallet : Tezos wallet on the browser (it give to me access to ghostnet)

⚠️ 🐳 About Taqueria : taqueria is using software images from Docker to run Ligo, etc ... Docker should be running on the machine 🐋
-> Then cd app && yarn install && yarn run start.
